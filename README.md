# Express Note Taker
## Link
https://github.com/julieritz/Express-Note-Taker
## Description
This note taker uses express to set up a server and store information from the notes. You can add a note and delete it, but not edit it.

This app is structured by:
- Creating a flat file database
- Using a series of functions to create website functionality (add a note, delete a note, etc.)
- Creating routes for the pages
- Creating our own api to store data
- Setting up the server and making sure it is listening on the right port
